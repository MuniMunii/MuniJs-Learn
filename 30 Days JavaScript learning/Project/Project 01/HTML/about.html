                        This was my first year when i learning how to code
                        and interested in programming, By the way i intrested on programming because my brother recommended me to join Bootcamp.
                        <span><a href="https://www.dicoding.com/academies/120-memulai-pemrograman-dengan-c" class="link-list-span">Here</a></span> and because of that 
                        I am interested in programming, and the first language I learned was C.
                        Even though i am a highschooler with an IT Background i am still struggling to learn programming because i really have zero knowledge in programming language.
                        But somehow i still finished the Bootcamp and i took another Bootcamp for JAVA Language in this bootcamp i finally understand the basics of programming like 
                        Data Primitives, conditional, Aritmethic operator and etc
